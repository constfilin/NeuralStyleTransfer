# Neural Style Transfer
Playing with Neural Style Transfer, learning Deep Neural Networks and TensorFlow

The code was initially based on Neural Style Transfer Python Jupiter Notebook available in [Coursera Convolutional Neural Networks course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks/home/welcome) from https://www.deeplearning.ai/.

I am trying to understand how it works, how to generalize it to apply to transfer of more than just image styles.
